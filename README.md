# Deepfake Detection Using XceptionNet
## Project Overview
Deepfakes are AI-generated media where a person in a video is replaced with someone else's likeness. Detecting these manipulations has become increasingly challenging with advances in deepfake technology. This project aims to build a reliable deepfake detection system using the XceptionNet model.
##We have trained our model using XceptionNet using a dataset in Kaggle.

The project supports video frame extraction, preprocessing, and prediction. XceptionNet, known for its superior performance in image classification tasks, helps ensure reliable detection of deepfake manipulations.

## Features
Deepfake Detection: Classifies videos as real or fake based on frame-level predictions.
Frame Extraction: Automatically extracts frames from videos to facilitate analysis.
Preprocessing: Rescales, resizes, and normalizes the video frames for input into the model.
Improved Accuracy: By leveraging XceptionNet and combining frame-based predictions, the system achieves better accuracy than traditional models.
